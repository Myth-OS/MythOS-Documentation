# MYTHOS - Declarations

This document declares the Mythos vision, mission, philosophy, and code of ethics. 


## Vision

Be a widely recognized phenomena of extraordinary collective inspiration.


## Mission

Catalyze positive change in people’s lives and our world with an extraordinary experience of enchantment, adventure, and celebration.  


## Philosophy (draft)

1 - CHOOSE CONSCIOUS EVOLUTION: our world is in a state of potent transformation.  This change is a natural part of an evolving species becoming a super-orgamism.  We can participate in how we navigate and guide this transformation.  We can consciously choose how we evolve (or devolve).  We must take responsibility for where we are going.  * Participatory epistemology.  

2 - CRAFT COHERENT PERSPECTIVES: there is great power in vision, perspective, in story, narrative, and myth.  We are in a crisis of meaning (ecological and sociological crisis are rooted in this crisis of meaning).  We lack a clear and collectively coherent vision of who we are and where we are going as a collective.  Apply conscious evolution by first crafting a coherent collective vision.   a crisis of meaning due to an imbalance of ‘collective intelligence’ relative to acceleration and potency of evolutionary change..  We need coherent stories of both our past and our future.  (AQ - aquarian artifact)

3 - COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE: individual transformation combined with organizing many individuals to collaborate at scale = Collective Intelligence.  We need a high order of collective intelligence to solve the very large and complex problems we face (which are normal given the stage of our evolutionary progress).  Empathy / empathic civilization, etc. Neo-democracy.  Economics as a measure of CI.  HI + AI = CI

4 - EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIENCE DESIGN: all people on the planet have at least one thing in common: we all want a good experience of being alive (tho there is a diversity to what ‘good experience’ means).  User experience design with a strong leaning toward encouraging conscious evolution.  Principles of gamification as optimal elements of user experience / hard wired in our minds.  Thus, an evolutionary game.  Incentivization as a key evolutionary trend.  PLAY

5 - UNITY IN DIVERSITY: spiral dynamics etc

6 - TECHNOLOGY CAN BE A MAGIC WAND: human relationship with technology is inherent in our evolutionary path (example).  all technology is a ‘double-edged sword’.  It can be yielded for extraordinary benefic creation or malefic destruction.  It is up to us (conscious evolution) to choose how to yield the sword.  The most magic is on the fringes of innovation and at the confluence of major innovation trends (DLT, AI, VR, BT, etc).  Enchantment as necessary toward action (enchantment over emergency for necessity to change ((emergency is usually the case, but enchantment can also begin the ‘call’?)

7 - MYTHOS LEADS TO ETHOS: invitation leads to action. ??? form and function.  Emptiness and form … lead with the tip of the spear
