# MYTHOS - Declarations

This document declares the Mythos vision, mission, philosophy, and code of ethics. 


## Vision

Be a widely recognized phenomena of collective inspiration.


## Mission

Catalyze positive change in people’s lives and our world with an extraordinary experience of enchantment, adventure, and celebration.  


## Philosophy (draft)

1 - **CONSCIOUS EVOLUTION**: 

*“In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity” ~ Sun-Tzu*

As our world moves thru potent changes, we can recognize that we have a choice in how we participate in navigating and guiding transformation.  We have free will, and can consciously choose how we evolve (or devolve).  By taking responsibility for where we are and looking to where we want to go, we are less likely to arrive somewhere we don’t want to be, and much more likely to arrive to exactly where we do want to be.

2 - **SOVEREIGN INTERDEPENDENCE**:

*sovereign interdependence = autonomous, self-sufficent, and self-governing individuals + collaborative, self-governing collective* (sovereign at both the individual and collective levels)

"The people are the government, administering it by their agents; they are the government, the sovereign power." ~ Andrew Jackson

"I believe that sovereignty is the twin sister of democracy. If there's no sovereignty, there's no democracy." ~ Marine Le Pen

Sovereign (legal). We are our own rulers.  We have the right, privilege, and responsibility to govern and ‘parent’ ourselves.  

Global collective transformation begins at the level of individual transformation.  Like a cell within a body, many healthy cells equate to a healthy whole.  Individuals who are becoming stable and centered in their own sufficiency and purpose establish an optimal basis for synergistic collaboration with each other, thus realzing a thriving, intelligent, interdependent collective together.    


3 - **EMPATHIC CIVILIZATION**

*“The most important question facing humanity is this: Can we reach global empathy in time to avoid the collapse of civilization and save the Earth?” ~ Jeremy Rifkin, The Empathic Civilization: The Race To Global Consciousness In A World In Crisis*

Unity in Diversity.  

Integrate diverse perspectives and value systems. 

Healthy natural ecologies (forests, jungles, oceans) thrive by a diversity of species living in balance.  The same is true for social ecologies where the values and perspectives of many different kinds of people can be regarded with balance in a totality.  

Current systems ingender apathy.  How to create systems that generate empathy?

The sum is greater than the parts.  

"None of us is as smart as all of us. Keeping your ideas to yourself is detrimental. Diversity of people equals diversity of ideas." ~ Denise Jacobs

“We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet.” 
― Joseph Campbell, The Power of Myth

Myths are public dreams, dreams are private myths. - Joseph Campbell

4 - **CRAFT MEANINGFUL PERSPECTIVES (narratives?)**: 

*“The universe is made of stories, not of atoms.” ~ Muriel Rukeyser*

There is great power in story, myth, and narrative.  Story provides meaningful perspective, helping to understand and settle the past, as well as provide possibility and vision for the future.

Traditionally, myth has has helped humanity understand our world, and supported the evolution of human culture.

Currently, humanity is in a crisis of meaning.  All ecological and sociological crises are rooted in this crisis of meaning.  The opportunity now is to collectively co-create a new mythos: a clear and coherent vision of who we are and who we are becoming.  But a new ‘mythos’ will not look like any other type of mythology we have seen before.  Everything in our world and about humanity is about to radically change, and so even our understanding of what a ‘mythos’ is may be very different.  
- A crisis of meaning due to an imbalance of ‘collective intelligence’ relative to acceleration and potency of evolutionary change.  We need healthy and coherent perspectives of both our past and our future. Stories are wisdom, empathic glue, etc (AQ - aquarian artifact)

- Life and vitality trumps meaning.  Everyone has at least one thing in common: we all want a good experience of being alive.  A myth of living.  A living myth.   


5 - **COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE**: 

“Collective Intelligence (CI) is the capacity of human collectives to engage in intellectual cooperation in order to create, innovate, and invent.” ~ Pierre Levy

Today we face global problems of such great scale and complexity that are unprecedented in our our history.  We have never faced problems like this before--problems that breach the comprehension of any single indivudual or small group.  To solve these large problems, we must approach them with a level of intelligence that matches the scale of the issues.  By harnessing Collective Intelligence, we may rise to an order of intelligent organization and scale that can provide global scale solutions. 

Individual transformation combined with organizing many individuals to collaborate at scale = Collective Intelligence.  We need a high order of collective intelligence to solve the very large and complex problems we face (which are normal given the stage of our evolutionary progress).  Empathy / empathic civilization, etc. Neo-democracy.  Economics as a measure of CI.  HI + AI = CI (“Radical Collective Intelligence”). This change is a natural part of an evolving species becoming a super-orgamism.  


6 - **EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIENCE DESIGN**:

"You’ve got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology." ~ Steve Jobs

"People say that what we’re all seeking is a meaning for life. I don’t think that’s what we’re really seeking. I think that what we’re seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances with our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive." 
― Joseph Campbell, The Power of Myth

"Follow your bliss and doors will open where there were no doors before." 
― Joseph Campbell, The Power of Myth

All people on the planet have at least one thing in common: we all want a good experience of being alive (tho there is a diversity to what ‘good experience’ means).  User experience design with a strong leaning toward encouraging conscious evolution.  Principles of gamification as optimal elements of user experience / hard wired in our minds.  Thus, an evolutionary game.  Incentivization as a key evolutionary trend.  PLAY


7 - **TECHNOLOGY CAN BE A MAGIC WAND**:

Human relationship with technology is inherent in our evolutionary path (example).  all technology is a ‘double-edged sword’.  It can be yielded for extraordinary benefic creation or malefic destruction.  It is up to us (conscious evolution) to choose how to yield the sword.  The most magic is on the fringes of innovation and at the confluence of major innovation trends (DLT, AI, VR, BT, etc).  Enchantment as necessary toward action (enchantment over emergency for necessity to change ((emergency is usually the case, but enchantment can also begin the ‘call’?)

Erik Davis quote?


8 - Balance of Decentralization and Centralization

"When decentralized blockchain protocols start displacing the centralized web services that dominate the current Internet, we'll start to see real internet-based sovereignty. The future Internet will be decentralized." ~ Olaf Carlson-Wee


9 - **MYTHOS LEADS TO ETHOS**: 

Mythos:
a myth or mythology.
- (in literature) a traditional or recurrent narrative theme or plot structure.
- a set of beliefs or assumptions about something.

Quote on mythos and/or ethos?

invitation leads to action. ??? form and function.  Emptiness and form … lead with the tip of the spear
