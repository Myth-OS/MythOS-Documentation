MYTHOS - Manifesto
MythOS: Mythos Operating System


Manifesto Outline:
1) WHO - is the audience, and who i am
2) WHERE - are we relative to a problem or need
4) WHY - this problem exists (break down assumption to first principles)
3) WHAT - is the solution, and what will happen after the solution
5) HOW - people can become involved and participate in the solution


Preamble

This manifesto document is intended to declare the purpose of the Mythos project, and provide a conceptual and philosophical basis for developing the project.  

The Mythos project has been in a mostly conceptual and “brainstorming” development process for years.  While there already exist many Mythos related materials: reams of notes, initial website, business plans, functional specifications, and graphic sketches (much of which may still be useful and applicable), this declarative document establishes the project on a “first principles” basis (https://mayooshin.com/first-principles-thinking).  This manifesto places most previous ideas and plans aside (for now at least), question assumptions, and defines the problem / solution sets by the most fundamental elements. From that foundation of understanding, the Mythos project can be built into a valuable product / service on solid ground.  

“Think different. Usually, when we’re faced with complex problems, we default to thinking like everybody else. First principles thinking is a powerful way to help you break out of this herd mentality, think outside the box and innovate completely brand new solutions to familiar problems.
By identifying your current assumptions, breaking these down into their basic truths and creating solutions from scratch—you can uncover these ingenious solutions to complex problems and make unique contributions in any field.”  -- First Principles Thinking





Primer

Overall, the purpose of the Mythos project is to actualize greater purpose and meaning in the world, and catalyze greater coherency of collective intelligence as a basis for humanity move forward during these extraordinary times.
The Meaning formula: … (see journals) … 



HI + AI = CI



The Radical Collective Intelligence (RCI) formula: borrowed from the Radish project (Radish.org) is that Human Intelligence (HI) combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI) results in greater Collective Intelligence (CI). 


HI + AI = CI


The Mythos project is established on these assumptions as first principles of addressing core problems with key solutions:

1 - core problem: the world is in a crisis of meaning.  

1.a - The world is in a crisis of meaning, and this is a problem because this crisis of meaning is such a fundamental problem, that many more problems are emerging and sustaining because of this crisis of meaning.  Ecological crises, economic crises, socio-political crises, and more problems all have primary roots in a collective crisis of meaning.  

1.b - This crisis of meaning is a natural result of our human species evolving (over many thousands of years) to develop enough intelligence and ingenuity to recognize ourselves as vastly distinctly from other species on this planet, and to …  Compared to other species, humans are incredibly dynamic, adaptive, and ingenuous.  While human culture has flourished and continued to rapidly develop over thousands of years, we appear to continually have an ability to continually move beyond ourselves in understandings and capabilities.  Because of our utter uniqueness and ****, combined with our ability to yield influence over our environments, we do not fully understand what we are, who we are, or what our ultimate purpose is.  In the least, whatever understandings or perspective we establish around this … this is usually quickly unsurped by new conditions and realizations beyond our previous understanding.  And now we find ourselves in apparent struggle (?) ...

- if everyone had clear understanding and perspective of individual purpose, AND we organize our diversity well … we would realize greater peace, harmony, and balance on the planet.


1.c - The crisis of meaning is operating at both individual and collective levels.

*** Is this true?  Is a crisis of meaning the root of the problem?  Or is it a crisis in intelligence--collective intelligence?  How are meaning and intelligence related?

2 - solution: meaning making is a result of clear and integrated perception of patterns.



3 - perception of patterns is a function of intelligence.  Both individual intelligence and collective intelligence.

4 - collective intelligence is a combination of HI + AI

5 - to increase individual intelligence toward meaning making 


6 - a basis of a new mythos is provided (Aquarian Artifact etc, based on geometry, and elements of the new paradigm: TP, AI, ET, DT, TR, MR … but the system also provides enough universal generalization to allow the collective to continue to evolve the mythos in unique (potentially even diverse ways).

7 - Myths / stories / narratives in themselves are sets of assumptions that people (individuals and collectives) often base their beliefs and behaviors on.  By providing a platform for people to 1) get clear on their “myths” of operating assumptions, 2) realize how they might change “the story” to change the assumptions (and vice versa), 3) then declare these new individual “myths” in a more open and public format, 4) as well as group together with other people (as collectives) to declare new collectively held “myths” 

PRINCIPLES (why 1): (deeper needs)
	1) Humanity needs a clear vision of new guiding narratives.

	2) Astrology itself needs a new guiding narrative.

	3) Newly emerging Archetypal Cosmology (and subset Archetypal Astrology) can provide a meta-narrative framework for new evolutionary narratives for humanity, and is the beginning of a new story for "astrology" itself.

	Archetypal cosmology includes the study of the correlations between cyclical alignments of the planets and archetypal patterns in human experience (archetypal astrology), but goes beyond this to address the theoretical basis of these correlations and their implications for the wider contemporary world view. Consequently, archetypal cosmology is a multidisciplinary subject drawing on scholarship from many other areas such as depth psychology, history, philosophy, cosmology, religious studies, cultural studies, the arts, and the social and natural sciences.


archetypal historiography

+ individuation & collectivization (Chardin: hyperpersonalization and centrification)

+ ontology + epistemology = meaningful technology


SUMMARY (what):

	• MYTHOS is a “mythic operating system” (MythOS), a software platform as “mythological” framework (software as myth = “SaM”) designed to provide meaningful perspectives, life orientation, and transformational guidance for individuals and collectives. 

	• MYTHOS emerges and exists at the intersection and confluence of Information Technology and Transpersonal Psychology (ITTP).

	• MYTHOS is designed around research and key insights in Cognitive Psychology, Transpersonal Psychology, Mythology, Philosophy, and Archetypal Cosmology to help people better understand themselves and the course of their lives within a rapidly changing world.

	• MTYHOS provides an interactive dashboard interface allowing people to explore their Individuation Index / Process State (IDI / IPS), an integrated real-time report of both external process metrics (quantified self) and internal process metrics (quantified transpersonal self, or Transpersonal Identification” (TPI): an integrated composite of both syncretic information derived from a variety of esoteric systems (such as Western Astrology, Eastern Astrology, Numerology, and more). *** biometrics and psychometrics

	• MTYHOS provides tools and methods to document and monitor the progress of their personal transformation process (individuation), and enhances this documentation with game-like features such as accomplishment badges.

	• MTYHOS provides a dynamic interactive timeline of planetary transits for both their personal astrological transits, as well as world transits.  The timeline also allows a person to explore archetypically relevant multi-media content (images, videos, music, etc) of people and events in human history, and compare these archetypal events to their own archetypal life process.  

	• MYTHOS, over time, develops a Universal Language of Consilience, a transcendental pattern language of psychological, philosophical, and cosmological significance.  This includes a Holonomic Pattern Language (HPL) and Synaesthetic MetaGlyphs (SMGs)
	• MYTHOS allows people to explore and interact with a social network of other people in a game-like environment.  A system of “Social Alchemy” provides people with methods of recognizing interpersonal synergy potentials.

	• MTYHOS utilizes seasoned design practices and cutting edge information technology to provide people with an optimal experience in using the system.  This includes:
		- Fluid UI: real-time, game-like interactions with the interface 
		- Agnostic API: 
		- Data Sanctity: decentralized, member-controlled, secure, and mobile data storage using blockchain technology
		- VR/AR:

MYTHOS MANIFESTO:

[ MYTHOS is  mythological framework based largely on archetypal astrology and cosmology ] 

> new MYTH is the discovery and exploration of the interior realm, the “order of realities” of the psyche.

[ hence, MYTHOS pattern language interface ]

How is MythOS a MYTHOLOGICAL OPERATING SYSTEM?

Famous mythologist Joseph Campbell ... “
> [ image of Joseph Campbell ]
Said that humanity is in need of a new MYTH” (*** QUOTE ***)
He outlined four (4) primary functions that a new myth should have:



> FUNCTION OF MYTH: 4 main functions (Campbell):

1 - Mystical or Metaphysical function
	- syncretism of many esoteric systems
2 - Cosmological function
	- Archetypal Cosmology
3 - Sociological function
	- decentralized social alchemy network
4 - Pedagogical or Psychological function
	- guiding and tracking the individuation process


…the first function of mythology [is] to evoke in the individual a sense of grateful, affirmative awe before the monstrous mystery that is existence 
The second function of mythology is to present an image of the cosmos, an image of the universe round about, that will maintain and elicit this experience of awe. [or] …to present an image of the cosmos that will maintain your sense of mystical awe and explain everything that you come into contact with in the universe around you. 
The third function of a mythological order is to validate and maintain a certain sociological system: a shared set of rights and wrongs, proprieties or improprieties, on which your particular social unit depends for its existence. 
4. …the fourth function of myth is psychological. That myth must carry the individual through the stages of his life, from birth through maturity through senility to death. The mythology must do so in accords with the social order of his group, the cosmos as understood by his group, and the monstrous mystery.


“Myth basically serves four functions. The first is the mystical function,... realizing what a wonder the universe is, and what a wonder you are, and experiencing awe before this mystery....The second is a cosmological dimension, the dimension with which science is concerned – showing you what shape the universe is, but showing it in such a way that the mystery again comes through.... The third function is the sociological one – supporting and validating a certain social order.... It is the sociological function of myth that has taken over in our world – and it is out of date.... But there is a fourth function of myth, and this is the one that I think everyone must try today to relate to – and that is the pedagogical function, of how to live a human lifetime under any circumstances.” 
― Joseph Campbell, The Power of Myth





The Mythos Operating System

The term “Mythos” means: 

myth·os
ˈmiTHōs,-äs/
noun
technical
noun: mythos; plural noun: mythoi
a myth or mythology.
(in literature) a traditional or recurrent narrative theme or plot structure.
a set of beliefs or assumptions about something.
The Mythos project is thus a MythOS: an Operating System (OS) for navigating the current mythos (or lack of mythos) in our global culture, and providing a platform for establishing a new mythos.

While myth and stories played 



Introduction: the problem of meaning, the solution of meaning
	- world in great transition
	- orientation to where we are going

Mythos as an Operating System
	- Not a traditional OS, an OS for operating in a system of meaning
	- the Mythos stack:
		- universal story archive
		- meaning layers (astrology, etc)
		- 

Representation
	- representation modules (Tom style)
	- image (supportive), words, audio (of reading words with background music)


Extensions
	- narrative therapy
*meaning* in geometric form (see journal notes)
