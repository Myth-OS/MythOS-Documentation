MYTHOS - Roadmap
MythOS: Mythos Operating System
_____________________________________________________________________

Introduction

This document outlines the Mythos execution plan from a high level (and may be updated as progress and pivots are made).


The development of the Mythos platform follows a high level methodology and pathway:
1 - IDEATION: establish fundamental understanding of the problem / solution set as “first principles” to build a valuable product / service / experience to build upon.   

2 - EXPERIMENTATION: generate simple and agile experiments to test first principles with real-world audiences to confirm value creation.   

3 - IMPLEMENTATION (delivery): develop successful experiments into highly functional and robust applications that can scale, and deliver systemic solutions into the real world.

4 - OPTIMIZATION: receive audience feedback, test, and continue to develop and innovate the project in new unrealized directions.
