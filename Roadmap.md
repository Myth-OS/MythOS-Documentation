# MYTHOS - Roadmap
## MythOS: Mythos Operating System
_______________________________________________________________________________________

**Introduction**

This document outlines the Mythos project execution plan (it will be updated as progress and pivots are made).

The development of Mythos follows a high level methodology and pathway:

1 - **IDEATION & EXPERIMENTATION** (brainstorm and brainswarm): establish solid conceptual foundations that ensure delivery of a valuable product / service / experience into the social sphere.

2 - **DEVELOPMENT & IMPLEMENTATION** (build and deliver): develop ideas and successful experiments into functional and robust applications that scale, delivering systemic solutions into the real world.

3 - **INNOVATION & OPTIMIZATION**: receive audience feedback (return to Phase 1), test, and continue to develop and innovate the project in potential new directions.

## Phase 1: IDEATION and EXPERIMENTATION
### July 2018 … on going ...

The primary aim of this initial phase is to establish solid conceptual foundations to ensure delivery of a valuable product / service / experience into the social sphere.  Simple and agile experiments can be conducted to test concepts with real-world audiences, and confirm value creation.   

Goals in realizing this phase are:

	1 - Complete a summary of the [Mythos Vision](Vision.md)
		1.a - declare the vision, mission, principles, and philosophy of the Mythos project. 
		1.b - define and clarify fundamental problem / solution sets from a “first principles” perspective (https://mayooshin.com/first-principles-thinking).
		1.c - design a high-level visual ‘map’ of Mythos vision and project scope (“Salt Lake City” planning style).

	2 - Outline a “Mythos Lab” list of ideas and protocols for experiments to conduct based on problem / solutions sets.

	3 - Conduct small, simple, agile experiments in real world settings, and input the results back into the experimentation process until value clarification is achieved.
		3.a - prepare MythicSystems.com as a portal to host the Mythos vision, and conduct real-world value experiments.

## Phase 2: DEVELOPMENT & IMPLEMENTATION
### TBD, 2018 

The primary aim of this phase is to develop ideas and successful experiments into functional and robust applications that scale, delivering systemic solutions into the real world.

Goals in realizing this phase will be defined after a first round is complete in Phase 1.
