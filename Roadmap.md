# MYTHOS - Roadmap

This document outlines the MythOS project execution plan (it will be updated as progress and pivots are made).

The development of Mythos follows a high level methodology and pathway:

1 - **IDEATION & EXPERIMENTATION** (brainstorm and brainswarm): establish solid conceptual foundations that ensure delivery of a valuable product / service / experience into the social sphere.

2 - **DEVELOPMENT & IMPLEMENTATION** (build and deliver): develop ideas and successful experiments into functional and robust applications that scale, delivering systemic solutions into the real world.

3 - **INNOVATION & OPTIMIZATION**: receive audience feedback (return to Phase 1), test, and continue to develop and innovate the project in potential new directions.

## Phase 1: IDEATION and EXPERIMENTATION
### July 2018 - April 2019

The primary aim of this initial phase is to establish solid conceptual foundations to ensure delivery of a valuable product / service / experience into the social sphere.  Simple and agile experiments can be conducted to test concepts with real-world audiences, and confirm value creation.   

Goals in realizing this phase are:

1 - Complete a comprehensive overview of the [Mythos Declarations](Declarations.md)

   - summarize vision, mission, philosophy, and code of ethics of the MythOS project. 

   - define and clarify fundamental problem / solution sets from a “first principles” perspective (https://mayooshin.com/first-principles-thinking).


2 - Revise and develop MythOS website (http://mythos.io) to host a comprehensive overview of the MythOS project.

3 - Derive results from “MythOS Systems Lab” experiments (see Mythic Systems [Roadmap](https://github.com/MythicSystems/Documents/blob/master/Roadmap.md), and integrate successful results into MythOS technology design and architecture [Specification](Specification.md).

## Phase 2: DEVELOPMENT & IMPLEMENTATION

### Phase 2-A: April 2019 - June 2019

The primary aim of this phase is to develop a functional MVP (Miniam Viable Product) application that serves as a demonstratable and operational prototype.  See the MythOS functional [Specification](Specification.md).

### Phase 2-B: June 2019 - September 2019

The primary aim of this phase is to leverage the prototype to gather more development funding, and to continue developing primary and secondary extensions to and from the MythOS platform.
