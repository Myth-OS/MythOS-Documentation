MYTHOS - Roadmap
MythOS: Mythos Operating System
_______________________________________________________________________________________

Introduction

This document outlines the Mythos execution plan from a high level (and may be updated as progress and pivots are made).


The development of the Mythos platform follows a high level methodology and pathway:
1 - IDEATION & EXPERIMENTATION (brainstorm and brainswarm): establish solid conceptual foundations that will ensure better delivery of a valuable product / service / experience into the social sphere.

2 - DEVELOPMENT & IMPLEMENTATION (build and deliver): develop successful experiments into highly functional and robust applications that can scale, delivering systemic solutions into the real world.

3 - INNOVATION & OPTIMIZATION: receive audience feedback (return to Phase 1), test, and continue to develop and innovate the project in new unrealized directions.

## Phase 1: IDEATION and EXPERIMENTATION
### July 2018 … on going ...


The primary aim of this initial phase is to establish solid conceptual foundations that will ensure better delivery of a valuable product / service / experience into the social sphere.  Simple and agile experiments can be conducted to test concepts with real-world audiences to confirm value creation.   

Goals in realizing this phase are:


1 - Complete a first draft of the Mythos Manifesto [*link*].
		1.a - declare the principles, philosophy, and vision of the Mythos project. 
		1.b - define and clarify fundamental problem / solution sets from a “first principles” perspective (https://mayooshin.com/first-principles-thinking). 
		1.c - design high-level visual ‘map’ of Mythos scope and project vision (“Salt Lake City” planning style).

    	2 - Outline a “Mythos Lab” list of ideas and protocols for experiments to conduct based on problem / solutions sets.  

    	3 - Conduct small, simple, agile experiments in real world settings, and feed the results back into the clarification and experimentation process.
		3.a - prepare MythicSystems.com as a portal to host the manifesto, and conduct various experiments.  


## Phase 2: DEVELOPMENT & IMPLEMENTATION
### TBD, 2018 


The primary aim of this phase is to develop successful experiments into highly functional and robust applications that can scale, delivering systemic solutions into the real wor

Goals in realizing this phase will be defined after a first round is complete in Phase 1.
