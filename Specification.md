# MYTHOS - Functional & Technical Specification
## MVP v1.01

This document describes and specifies the Mythos application design and architecture.


## INTRODUCTION

Mythos is a social platform that helps people gather, shape, and share personal stories of transformation in order to recognize the wisdom of their own journey, and build a collective vision of our future.

With Mythos, users are able to store their stories with words, images, audio, and video in a way that is consolidated, secure, and portable. Users are guided to craft and improve their stories using principles of story telling. A user's stories are gathered in a personal profile, and can be organized and represented in a variety of ways.  

Collective crowd sourcing and Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning) is applied to find connections between user's individual stories, and make recommendations to users of stories similar to theirs.  This process can engender a sense of connection and empathy between members, across the Mythos community, and within other social networks.
