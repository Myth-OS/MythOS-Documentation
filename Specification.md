# MYTHOS - Functional & Technical Specification
## MVP v1.01

This document describes and specifies the MythOS application design and architecture.


## INTRODUCTION

MythOS is a social platform that helps people gather, shape, and share personal stories of transformation in order to recognize the wisdom of their own journey, and build a collective vision of our future.

With MythOS, users are able to store their stories with words, images, audio, and video in a way that is consolidated, secure, and portable. Users are guided to craft and improve their stories using principles of story telling. A user's stories are gathered in a personal profile, and can be organized and represented in a variety of ways.  

Collective crowd sourcing and Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning) is applied to find connections between user's individual stories, and make recommendations to users of stories similar to theirs.  This process can engender a sense of connection and empathy between members, across the MythOS community, and within other social networks.

NOTE: a fundamental distinction is made between MythOS and Mythos.  MythOS is the generalized platform of universal features supporting a vast distributed social network oriented around the significance of personal story.  Mythos is a more specific implementation of the MythOS platform that extends upon universal features for a narrower target market. 

## VISION
### Product Vision
Initially, the focus is on providing ways for people to quickly and easily store their stories, improve their stories, and derive wisdom and insights from their personal stories.  

Ultimately, we want people's individual stories to combine and weave into a more coherent collective vision of humanity's story and vision.

### Technical Architecture 

MythOS will be established on distributed network technology (most likely either EOS, Holochain, or IOTA as the main platform, and IPFS for content storage).  

- agent-based 
- decentralized and/or distributed 

MythOS will use standard HTML5 and Javascript libraries (React, D3) for fluid and expressive User Interfaces.  

Machine Learning (Artificial Intelligence) TBD
